# UnifyID-challenge-

In the Java file Random.java, I have attempted the task of (1) returning a truly random number from random.org
and (2) creating a 128 * 128 RGB bitmap based on the random numbers

Random.java when run makes a HttpConnection to random.org to receive random numbers
which are then used to create the bitmap which is displayed through JFrame

I hope that I will be considered for the internship position at UnifyID as both a Full-Stack
and Android Engineer. I truly look forward to the opportunity to work with UnifyID and its team
